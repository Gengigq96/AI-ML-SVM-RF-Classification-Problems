# Classification with Support Vector Machines and Random Forest

## Objectives

This project aims to practice creating models based on **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Random Forest** algorithms. The goal is to gain a practical understanding of the differences between training these models for a specific classification problem.

### Goals:
- Understand the data preprocessing required for classification models.
- Apply the **Random Forest** algorithm to a classification problem.
- Apply the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm to a classification problem.
- Evaluate and analyze the performance of both classifiers.
- Investigate the application of classification models to real-world problems.

## Dataset Description

The dataset we will be using is the **Covertype dataset**, available at the following link: [Covertype Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype).

This dataset was generated to predict the type of forest cover solely based on cartographic variables (without remote sensing data). The actual type of forest cover for a given observation (cell size 30 x 30 meters) was determined from data collected by the **Resource Information System (RIS)** of the **Region 2 Forest Service (USFS)**. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)** and USFS data. The dataset is in its original form (not scaled) and contains binary columns (0 or 1) for categorical independent variables (such as wilderness areas and soil types).

The classification task will aim to predict the **soil type** based on the provided features.

### Tasks to be Completed
